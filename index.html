          <br />
          I am an experienced professional with a strong background in data
          engineering and cloud technology. I hold an undergraduate degree in
          Systems Engineering from the National University of San Marcos.<br />
          <br />Over the years, I have specialized in providing data solutions,
          taking on roles as a data engineer and technical leader. I've also
          earned certifications from industry leaders, including Azure and
          Databricks. <br />
          <br />
          Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through
          exercise and dancing. Traveling is a passion of mine, and I take every
          opportunity to explore new places. I also cherish spending time with
          my beloved dog, Bonnie.
